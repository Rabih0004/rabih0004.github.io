I created this my web portfolio using HTML5 and CSS3. I made the naivgation as burger menu and as the screen gets bigger, the navigation changes to inline-block at 768px width. I only used Bootstrap for the Navigation, but the rest is my own codes. The chanllenges I faced is the burger menu, it was not responsive at as the screen gets bigger. it was hard for me to modified it. The only way I fixed the issue is I found anther responsive burger menu that is made with bootstrap, and I applied to my css file. I also faced the issue with footer. I gave the footer "bottom:1" and the css won't except it, so I did my research and found that I have to put footer, .push and I removed the "bottom:1" from the css and it worked. I add temperory images of responsive website images; I will be uploading those seen and improving the website in the next future.
