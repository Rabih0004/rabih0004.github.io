        <blockquote>I love designing website <cite>Rabih Moumne</cite>.</blockquote>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is <em>Rabih Moumne</em>. I am from Beirut, Lebanon, and have been in Ottawa for four years.
            I am a friendly person and a fast learner when it comes to web development. I love to learn new skills to
            improve myself. I enjoy playing board games with my kids in my free time and computer games.
        </p>

        <p>In my previous studies, I took a Microsoft course on web development and did three months internship as a
            front-end web developer. I applied for <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">I.M.D</abbr> because it has
            other skills than web development, such as photography and graphic design. This is my 1<sup>st</sup> year in
            this program. I am looking forward to work with you all.
