        <h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
    Hello, my name is <em>Rabih Moumne</em>. I am from Beirut, Lebanon, and have been in Ottawa for four years. I am a friendly person and a fast learner when it comes to web development. I love to learn new skills to improve myself. I love designing website <cite>Rabih Moumne</cite> In my previous studies, I took a Microsoft course on web development and did three months internship as a front-end web developer.
    I applied for <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">I.M.D</abbr> because it has other skills than web development, such as photography and graphic design. This is my 1 <sup>st</sup> year in this program. I enjoy playing board games with my kids in my free time. I am looking to work with you all.
